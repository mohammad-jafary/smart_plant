# Smart Plant
This project is for my university. I want to make an smart plant vase that can let the plant grow with no interaction of human.  

This is a smiple project but very useful to learn about IoT. This project has the following topics:</br>
	1. Analog Sensors</br>
	2. Recieve Senors Data by Arduino</br>
	3. Send Sensor Data to RaspberryPi</br>
	4. Save Data to Database</br>
	5. Control Relays by RaspberryPi</br>
	6. Simple Webpage for this Project (Accessible through internet)</br>
