# Smart Plant
This project is for my university. I want to make an smart plant vase that can let the plant grow with no interaction of human.

This is a smiple project but very useful to learn about IoT. This project has the following topics:
	1. Analog Sensors
	2. Recieve Senors Data by Arduino
	3. Send Sensor Data to RaspberryPi
	4. Save Data to Database
	5. Control Relays by RaspberryPi
	6. Simple Webpage for this Project (Accessible through internet)
